  weaponized_vulnerability: {
    shared: "You both came into this conversation with tender history—things you've shared to feel closer, not to be thrown back as weapons. The fact that this hurts likely means that what was shared really mattered.",
    therapist: "Weaponized vulnerability is one of the quickest ways to erode emotional safety in a relationship. When someone shares something hard—like a past mistake, trauma, or insecurity—they're trusting it will be held with care. But if it later gets used as ammo in conflict, it activates deep shame and fear. Over time, it trains the nervous system not to open up again. This creates emotional walls that are hard to tear down without repair.",
    unbiased: "Sometimes, in the heat of the moment, we reach for what we know will hurt—because we're hurt too. That doesn't make it okay, but it does make it human. The repair comes not just from apology, but from rebuilding trust that vulnerability will be honored, even in disagreement.",
    tryThis: "If you said something that brought up a past hurt or used a personal detail against your partner, take accountability. A simple phrase: \"I was wrong to use that against you. That wasn't fair.\" Then ask: \"What would help you feel safer sharing things with me again?\""
  },
  broken_trust: {
    shared: "When one of you feels like promises fall through or follow-through is missing, it's not just about logistics—it's about emotional safety. Consistency builds trust. And trust builds connection.",
    therapist: "Trust isn't built on grand gestures—it's built on repeated follow-through. When someone says they'll show up, do something, or be a certain way—and then that breaks down repeatedly—it can feel like emotional whiplash. The nervous system starts to anticipate disappointment. This is especially hard for someone with abandonment wounds or unmet childhood needs. Repair doesn't require perfection—it requires reliability.",
    unbiased: "It's common to underestimate how much small broken promises add up. Maybe your partner isn't mad about the task itself—they're hurting from feeling deprioritized or unseen. But on the other side, it's also common to feel overwhelmed and like you're doing your best. It's okay to name capacity and rebuild trust at the same time.",
    tryThis: "Choose one recurring commitment—big or small—that you'll protect this week. Whether it's bedtime, dinner, or a check-in call—let your actions show what matters. And if something slips, own it quickly with a phrase like: \"I know I dropped the ball. You matter to me, and I'll do better.\""
  },
  emotional_invalidation: {
    shared: "You both want to feel heard—not fixed, not shut down, not judged. Just heard. When emotions are running high, it's easy to miss that the deepest need isn't agreement—it's acknowledgment.",
    therapist: "Emotional invalidation happens when someone's feelings are ignored, minimized, or dismissed—intentionally or not. Phrases like \"You're overreacting,\" \"That's not what happened,\" or \"You always make it a big deal\" can trigger shame and defensiveness. Over time, repeated invalidation teaches a partner to silence themselves. The goal isn't always to solve the problem—it's to create space where both people feel safe expressing how they feel without judgment.",
    unbiased: "When someone feels unheard, it doesn't mean you intended to ignore them. You may have been trying to de-escalate, explain, or keep things calm. But the impact still hurts. Real repair means shifting from \"let me defend myself\" to \"let me reflect what you're feeling.\"",
    tryThis: "Use a validating phrase before offering your perspective. Something like: \"I can tell this hit you hard, and I want to understand more.\" Then pause and let them respond before jumping in. Listening deeply often softens the whole conversation."
  },
  emotional_shutdown: {
    shared: "When one of you shuts down, the other often ramps up. It's not because they want to argue—it's because they're reaching for connection. And when you go silent, it can feel like abandonment in real time.",
    therapist: "Emotional shutdown is often a defense mechanism—not a rejection. For some, conflict feels physically overwhelming. Their body goes into freeze mode to avoid saying something harmful or feeling too much. But for the partner on the receiving end, that silence can feel like being emotionally erased. This dynamic creates a pursuer/withdrawer pattern that's painful on both sides. Repair means understanding the fear behind withdrawal and learning how to stay engaged without flooding.",
    unbiased: "It's common for one partner to need time and space, while the other needs reassurance and resolution. Neither is wrong—but without communication, this difference can feel like rejection or pressure. Finding a shared language for what's happening in the moment helps both people feel less alone inside it.",
    tryThis: "Use a cue that keeps connection open without pushing: \"I want to talk about this, but I need a short break to come back regulated.\" Or if you're on the other side: \"I'm not trying to push—I just need to know you haven't checked out on me completely.\" Set a return time or signal so the silence doesn't feel like abandonment."
  },
  effort_imbalance: {
    shared: "When it feels like one of you is carrying more—more emotion, more tasks, more repair—it's easy to feel resentful. But most of the time, it's not about laziness. It's about different thresholds, and different ways of coping.",
    therapist: "Effort imbalances often emerge when one partner defaults to over-functioning: managing emotions, initiating repair, handling the logistics of life or the relationship. The other may under-function—not out of disrespect, but out of habit, overwhelm, or fear of doing it wrong. Over time, this creates burnout on one side and guilt or defensiveness on the other. True repair means naming the pattern—not blaming the person—and rebalancing together.",
    unbiased: "One of you may be feeling invisible, exhausted, or unappreciated. The other may feel nagged, inadequate, or like they can't do it right. Neither feeling makes you wrong—it just means you're stuck in roles that don't feel fair. The fix isn't doing everything or nothing—it's doing the next thing together.",
    tryThis: "Ask each other: \"What's one way I could show up better for you this week?\" \"What's one thing I need help carrying right now?\" Make the invisible visible. Small adjustments in shared effort lead to big changes in emotional connection."
  },
  miscommunication_loops: {
    shared: "You probably weren't fighting about what you thought you were. Most conflict loops start with a misread tone, a missing word, or a message that landed wrong. It's not that you don't care—it's that you got caught in the fog of reaction.",
    therapist: "Escalation loops are like emotional ping-pong—one person reacts, the other defends, and the real issue disappears beneath the noise. These patterns are exhausting, not because the love is gone, but because clarity got lost in the cycle. What started as a small disagreement often grows bigger due to tone misfires, assumptions, or rushed responses. The goal in repair isn't just resolution—it's clarity. Saying, \"Wait—what are we actually fighting about?\" can stop the spiral mid-spin.",
    unbiased: "You're not bad at communicating—you're just stuck in a rhythm that turns misunderstandings into arguments. One of you might need more context. The other might need more softness. When you slow the cycle, you both start to feel heard again.",
    tryThis: "Use a \"reset\" question when things get heated: \"What did you hear me say just now?\" \"Can I try saying that again in a better way?\" Often, the fight isn't about disagreement—it's about delivery. Resetting the tone can bring the clarity back into reach."
