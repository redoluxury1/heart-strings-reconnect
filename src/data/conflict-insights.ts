  weaponized_vulnerability: {
    shared: "You both came into this conversation with tender history—things you've shared to feel closer, not to be thrown back as weapons. The fact that this hurts likely means that what was shared really mattered.",
    therapist: "Weaponized vulnerability is one of the quickest ways to erode emotional safety in a relationship. When someone shares something hard—like a past mistake, trauma, or insecurity—they're trusting it will be held with care. But if it later gets used as ammo in conflict, it activates deep shame and fear. Over time, it trains the nervous system not to open up again. This creates emotional walls that are hard to tear down without repair.",
    unbiased: "Sometimes, in the heat of the moment, we reach for what we know will hurt—because we're hurt too. That doesn't make it okay, but it does make it human. The repair comes not just from apology, but from rebuilding trust that vulnerability will be honored, even in disagreement.",
    tryThis: "If you said something that brought up a past hurt or used a personal detail against your partner, take accountability. A simple phrase: \"I was wrong to use that against you. That wasn't fair.\" Then ask: \"What would help you feel safer sharing things with me again?\""
  },
  broken_trust: {
    shared: "When one of you feels like promises fall through or follow-through is missing, it's not just about logistics—it's about emotional safety. Consistency builds trust. And trust builds connection.",
    therapist: "Trust isn't built on grand gestures—it's built on repeated follow-through. When someone says they'll show up, do something, or be a certain way—and then that breaks down repeatedly—it can feel like emotional whiplash. The nervous system starts to anticipate disappointment. This is especially hard for someone with abandonment wounds or unmet childhood needs. Repair doesn't require perfection—it requires reliability.",
    unbiased: "It's common to underestimate how much small broken promises add up. Maybe your partner isn't mad about the task itself—they're hurting from feeling deprioritized or unseen. But on the other side, it's also common to feel overwhelmed and like you're doing your best. It's okay to name capacity and rebuild trust at the same time.",
    tryThis: "Choose one recurring commitment—big or small—that you'll protect this week. Whether it's bedtime, dinner, or a check-in call—let your actions show what matters. And if something slips, own it quickly with a phrase like: \"I know I dropped the ball. You matter to me, and I'll do better.\""
  },
  emotional_invalidation: {
    shared: "You both want to feel heard—not fixed, not shut down, not judged. Just heard. When emotions are running high, it's easy to miss that the deepest need isn't agreement—it's acknowledgment.",
    therapist: "Emotional invalidation happens when someone's feelings are ignored, minimized, or dismissed—intentionally or not. Phrases like \"You're overreacting,\" \"That's not what happened,\" or \"You always make it a big deal\" can trigger shame and defensiveness. Over time, repeated invalidation teaches a partner to silence themselves. The goal isn't always to solve the problem—it's to create space where both people feel safe expressing how they feel without judgment.",
    unbiased: "When someone feels unheard, it doesn't mean you intended to ignore them. You may have been trying to de-escalate, explain, or keep things calm. But the impact still hurts. Real repair means shifting from \"let me defend myself\" to \"let me reflect what you're feeling.\"",
    tryThis: "Use a validating phrase before offering your perspective. Something like: \"I can tell this hit you hard, and I want to understand more.\" Then pause and let them respond before jumping in. Listening deeply often softens the whole conversation."
