    detailedDescription: {
      emotionalCore: "At the heart of your Love Code is this quiet truth: when someone loves me, they'll show up. You feel most emotionally safe when love is expressed *through effort.* Helpful Actions aren't about chores — they're about *support.* You notice when your partner steps in to lighten your load, to make your life easier, or to handle something they didn't have to. Those moments say: *\"I've got you.\"*\n\nYou may have grown up equating love with responsibility — and over time, you've learned to associate care with action. You don't just want to be told that you're important — you want to *see it lived out.* Love, for you, feels most real when your partner notices your needs and responds to them without being asked. It gives you a sense of safety, partnership, and emotional grounding.\n\nWhen someone follows through, takes initiative, or removes something from your mental load, your nervous system exhales. You don't need huge romantic gestures. You need *reliable ones.* You thrive in environments where consistency matters more than theatrics — where \"I'm here\" is proven in the little ways, over and over.",
      howYouFeelLoved: "You feel most loved when your partner sees the invisible weight you carry — and helps you carry it. Whether it's washing dishes without being asked, running errands when you're tired, or jumping in with the kids so you can catch a breath — these are the moments that say, *\"You're not alone.\"*\n\nYou may not always know how to ask for help — but you deeply notice when it's offered freely. One of the most tender things your partner can do for you is *notice what's hard for you* — and then act on it. Even small, everyday efforts (like bringing you water, remembering what needs fixing, or anticipating what you need before you speak it) land deeply in your emotional world.\n\nTo you, support is intimacy. You feel closest when someone isn't just watching you do it all, but stepping in beside you — not for credit, not for performance, but because they genuinely want to carry life *with* you. That's when you feel most loved.",
      oftenMisread: "This Love Code is often misunderstood — people may think you don't need affection, or that you're too focused on logistics. But this couldn't be further from the truth. You don't need less emotion — you need *emotion lived out.* You're someone who pays attention to whether love is backed by action. And when it's not, you can start to feel emotionally disconnected, even if the words are still being said.\n\nPartners who express love verbally or physically may think they're doing everything right, but if they consistently fail to *show up in the day-to-day,* you may feel unseen or unappreciated. You might not say anything right away — but over time, resentment can build. It's not that you're transactional — it's that effort matters to you. And when it's missing, something fundamental starts to feel off.\n\nYou may also struggle to feel connected to people who overpromise and under-deliver. You value reliability more than charm. And when others misread this as being \"too practical\" or \"emotionally cold,\" it can be painful — because inside, you're deeply loving. You just believe love should *show up and follow through.*",
      relationalGrowthTips: "It's okay to ask for what you need — clearly, calmly, and without guilt. You're not asking for perfection — you're asking for partnership. Try saying things like: \"When you help me without me asking, it makes me feel incredibly supported,\" or \"One of the ways I feel most loved is when you take something off my plate.\"\n\nAlso remember to name your needs *before* you hit burnout. Because you're so capable, others may assume you don't need help. But you do — and you deserve it. The more you can express, \"I want to feel like we're in this together,\" the more room your partner has to meet you in meaningful ways.\n\nLastly, reflect on how you give love. You likely show it by doing — fixing, helping, managing. That's beautiful — but it's okay to also receive. Let your partner know: *\"Support is love to me.\"* Because for someone like you, love isn't a feeling alone. It's *what we do when we care.*"

    secondaryDescription: "You may not always realize it, but you light up when someone steps in to help you, especially when they do it without being asked. You appreciate actions that show care — when someone lightens your load, follows through, or anticipates your needs. Even if this isn't your top Love Code, it still builds emotional safety for you. Support speaks volumes, and when it's consistent, it deepens your trust."

    title: "Physical Connection",
    emotionalCore: "You process emotions through touch and physical proximity, finding security in physical connection.",
    howYouFeelLoved: "Physical affection—from hand-holding to long hugs to intimate connection—helps you feel most secure and valued.",
    oftenMisread: "You might be seen as clingy or solely focused on intimacy when you're truly seeking emotional connection through physical means.",
    growthTips: "Respect that not everyone processes emotions through touch. Communicate when you need physical connection rather than just reaching out.",
    shortSummary: "Touch is your primary language of love. Physical closeness—from casual affection to deeper intimacy—helps you feel connected, secure, and valued.",

    detailedDescription: {
      emotionalCore: "For you, physical connection is emotional connection. It's not just about intimacy — it's about presence. Your body holds memory, and the safest, most comforting thing in the world is to *feel* someone's love, not just hear or see it. When your partner is physically close — whether through hugs, kisses, hand-holding, or cuddling — it creates an emotional grounding that can't be replaced by words or acts alone.\n\nTouch is your love language because it helps regulate your nervous system. A warm embrace during conflict, a hand on your back in a moment of overwhelm, or laying together in silence — these are the moments that whisper, *\"You're safe. I'm here.\"* Without that closeness, even the best intentions can feel distant. You're someone who connects emotionally through physical nearness.\n\nThis Love Code isn't about constant affection or sexuality — it's about *reassurance in presence.* When your partner draws near instead of pulling away, it signals to your entire being that love is still alive, still reachable, still present in the moment.",
      howYouFeelLoved: "You feel most loved when affection is freely given — not just in romantic settings, but in everyday life. A hug in the kitchen. A spontaneous back rub. Sitting close on the couch instead of across the room. These gestures remind you that love is active, safe, and alive between you.\n\nIn moments of joy, physical touch amplifies celebration. In moments of conflict, it softens tension. For you, physical closeness isn't an afterthought — it's how you know someone is emotionally attuned to you. Even brief, gentle touch — like brushing fingers while walking — signals that your partner is connected to *you*, not just the conversation or the moment.\n\nYou're most alive in relationships that honor your need for contact. And when that need is met, your heart becomes more open, your communication deepens, and your overall sense of intimacy becomes stronger and more secure.",
      oftenMisread: "This Love Code is often misunderstood — people may assume it's only about physical attraction or sexual desire. But for you, physical connection is about *emotional safety.* When your partner avoids affection, pulls away during stress, or stops initiating touch altogether, it can make you feel unloved or even rejected — even if they're trying to show love in other ways.\n\nPartners who don't naturally give physical affection might not realize how deeply their distance is felt. They may say, *\"I'm just not a touchy person,\"* or *\"You know I love you,\"* without realizing how much you're *aching* for closeness. This can create a painful emotional mismatch — where one person thinks everything's fine, and the other feels emotionally abandoned.\n\nIn conflict, this can show up as physical withdrawal. If your partner shuts down or moves away when things get hard, it may hit you harder than they realize. You don't need touch to solve the problem — but you do need it to feel like the connection is still alive. A partner's presence, physically and emotionally, is what helps you stay anchored through hard moments.",
      relationalGrowthTips: "Be open about how much physical closeness means to you — not just in romantic settings, but in everyday emotional wellbeing. Let your partner know: *\"Touch helps me feel safe and connected.\"* Normalize affection as part of your relational rhythm, not something reserved for special occasions or intimacy alone.\n\nYou can also model this in ways that are gentle and non-demanding — like reaching for their hand when you're walking, or giving a warm touch during conversations. When you make physical affection safe, light, and consistent, it becomes something they begin to associate with emotional closeness too.\n\nFinally, reflect on how you handle emotional distance. If you feel rejected, do you retreat completely or try to overcompensate through touch? Learning to name the need — *\"I miss feeling close to you\"* — can help bridge the gap more clearly. Your desire for connection through touch is *not too much.* It's a beautiful way you offer love — and long to receive it in return."

    secondaryDescription: "Physical closeness, even if not your top need, still plays a key role in how you feel bonded. A warm hug, holding hands, or cuddling during downtime helps regulate your nervous system and bring emotional comfort. You might not crave constant affection, but when it's missing, you feel it. Affection adds depth to your connection, especially in quiet or emotionally tender moments."
