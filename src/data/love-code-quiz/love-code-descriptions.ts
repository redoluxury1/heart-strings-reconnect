    title: "Affirming Words",
    emotionalCore: "You feel most connected when emotions are named and expressed verbally. Words matter deeply to you.",
    howYouFeelLoved: "You feel most loved when your partner speaks affirmation, appreciation, and loving sentiments out loud—from daily check-ins to deep conversations.",
    oftenMisread: "You might be misread as needy or validation-seeking when you're truly seeking emotional transparency and clear communication.",
    growthTips: "Remember that not everyone processes emotions verbally. Your partner might show love in other ways that don't involve the words you crave.",
    shortSummary: "Words of affirmation and verbal expressions of love resonate most deeply with you. You connect through conversation and feel most secure when feelings are named out loud.",

    detailedDescription: {
      emotionalCore: "At your core, words don't just inform — they anchor you emotionally. You're someone who experiences connection through clarity, articulation, and tone. When love is spoken with sincerity, you don't just hear it — you feel it. Words are how you orient yourself in a relationship: they help you feel valued, secure, and known.\n\nYour nervous system responds to tone. A gentle \"I see you,\" or a vulnerable \"I'm sorry,\" lands deeper than actions alone. Even brief affirmations — a soft \"I missed you\" or \"I'm so lucky to have you\" — carry weight far beyond their syllables. This is because language is your access point to emotional safety. Without it, you may feel disoriented, even if everything else seems \"fine\" on the surface.\n\nFor you, language holds memories. You remember the sweet things people say long after the moment has passed. Harsh words, silence, or emotionally flat conversations can feel like deep ruptures — not because you're dramatic, but because you value emotional honesty. Words don't just matter. They mean everything.",
      howYouFeelLoved: "You feel loved when someone speaks to you with warmth, presence, and intention. When your partner notices the little things you're doing and tells you — not just thinks it — it fills a reservoir inside you that actions alone can't reach. A compliment about your heart. A message during the day saying, \"I'm proud of you.\" A soft tone when things feel tense. These aren't just niceties to you — they're connection threads.\n\nEven more than that, it's the consistency of language that counts. You don't just want one perfect speech — you want the small, steady reminders that love is here, alive, and seen. Affirming Words people thrive when conversations are reflective, affirming, and emotionally curious. You want to feel spoken to from the heart — not from obligation. You're most alive when you hear, \"Here's how I feel about you, and I want you to know.\"\n\nWhen a partner can verbalize appreciation, repair, or affection clearly and vulnerably — especially during hard moments — that's when you feel most safe, most connected, and most secure in the relationship.",
      oftenMisread: "Because you value words so deeply, others might misinterpret your needs as \"needy,\" \"sensitive,\" or even \"insecure.\" But it's not about needing constant reassurance — it's about knowing that love is still alive between the lines. When someone goes silent during conflict, or avoids verbal connection altogether, it can trigger feelings of abandonment or doubt for you — not because you're irrational, but because words are your signal of emotional presence.\n\nPeople who don't share this Love Code may think their actions speak louder than words — and while you appreciate action, it doesn't reach the same emotional depth for you. In relationships, this can lead to a painful mismatch: one partner feels they're showing love by doing, while you may be wondering why they aren't saying anything.\n\nEven worse, words used carelessly — sharp tone, sarcasm, passive-aggressive remarks — hit deeper than they realize. For someone with your Love Code, tone is intimacy. It matters how things are said. The absence of tenderness in language can feel like distance, even if everything else is functioning. This is often misunderstood — and it can make you feel like your emotional needs are \"too much.\" They're not.",
      relationalGrowthTips: "Own your Love Code without apology — but learn to communicate your needs clearly, not expect your partner to just \"know.\" Phrases like, \"I connect most through words, and I'd love to hear what you're feeling,\" can open the door gently. You can model this by speaking affection first — giving the kind of love you long to receive. Often, people learn how to speak love because of you.\n\nIn conflict, your tendency may be to chase clarity through conversation — wanting to fix things through words. This is a gift — but it can become overwhelming for partners who process differently. Practice patience. Ask, \"When would be a good time to talk about this?\" or \"Can we come back to this in a way that feels good for both of us?\" You don't have to silence yourself — you just have to pace the conversation with love.\n\nAlso reflect: when do you go quiet? Do you shut down when you're hurt or disappointed with the way something was said? Sometimes the best thing you can do is let someone know — \"Words matter to me, and this felt like a disconnection.\" This Love Code doesn't make you fragile. It makes you attuned. Speak love clearly — and teach others how to speak it back."

    secondaryDescription: "While this may not be your primary Love Code, affirming words still matter to you more than most people realize. When someone tells you what they appreciate about you — out loud — it leaves a lasting emotional imprint. You respond to sincere compliments, encouragement, and check-ins that remind you you're cared for. In tough moments, even a simple \"I'm here\" or \"You're doing great\" can soften your heart and help you reconnect faster. Words aren't everything — but they still carry weight."

    title: "Thoughtful Support",
    emotionalCore: "You notice the small things and feel most loved when your partner goes out of their way to surprise or delight you.",
    howYouFeelLoved: "Unexpected notes, small gifts, or thoughtful gestures that show they've been thinking of you make you feel cherished and remembered.",
    oftenMisread: "You might be seen as materialistic when you're truly looking for the thoughtfulness behind the gesture rather than the thing itself.",
    growthTips: "Be direct about what you need rather than hoping your partner will intuitively know. Not everyone naturally thinks in terms of symbolic gestures.",
    shortSummary: "You feel most loved through small, thoughtful gestures and surprises that show you're on your partner's mind. These little acts of consideration speak volumes to you.",
    color: "#FFDEE2", // Soft pink
    detailedDescription: {
      emotionalCore: "You experience love through evidence of attention. For you, it's not just about what someone says or how much time they give — it's about what they notice, and how they turn that noticing into small, intentional acts. The deeper belief beneath this Love Code is: \"If you really know me, you'll remember the little things.\"\n\nYou feel emotionally secure when your partner tunes into you enough to reflect your inner world back to you through tangible moments. That could be a favorite snack left on the counter, a thoughtful note in your bag, or a small gift that says, \"I was listening.\" These moments don't have to be extravagant — they just need to feel personal.\n\nYour nervous system responds to gestures as confirmation that you are seen and remembered — not just when things are romantic or serious, but in the day-to-day rhythm of life. When a partner expresses love in a way that feels designed just for you, it tells your body and brain: I matter to you, even when I'm not asking for anything.",
      howYouFeelLoved: "You feel most loved when your partner takes the time to do something they didn't have to do — something that required thought. Whether it's a spontaneous coffee delivery, your favorite playlist playing in the car, or a \"just because\" note left for you to find, these moments hit different. You crave surprise, not in the dramatic sense, but in the meaningful sense — like they saw something and thought of you.\n\nYou're especially sensitive to being remembered. When someone pays attention to what you've said (even weeks ago) and circles back with an action that reflects it, you feel deeply connected. These gestures say: \"I've been holding a part of you in my mind, even when you weren't around.\" That creates emotional intimacy in a way words or time alone can't quite replicate.\n\nYou don't need material things — you need thoughtfulness. The gesture is the symbol of the care. For you, love is in the symbolism: the energy they spent, the noticing they did, the moment they created. And when that effort is genuine, it stays with you for a long time.",
      oftenMisread: "People may mistake your Love Code as being \"gift-focused\" or materialistic — but that completely misses the point. You don't need expensive things. You need meaningful things. The deeper need here is not for objects, but for significance. You long to feel uniquely known — and when someone gives you something generic, or clearly didn't put thought behind it, it can actually feel worse than nothing at all.\n\nIn relationships, this Love Code is often misread because it's not always verbal. You might not say directly, \"I wish you brought me something,\" but your disappointment may come through when things feel repetitive, transactional, or generic. Without thoughtful gestures, your relationship may begin to feel flat, even if your partner is saying \"I love you\" or spending time with you. That's because love — to you — is in the effort and creativity.\n\nConflict can be especially difficult when your Love Code is misunderstood. A partner might say, \"I told you I love you,\" or \"I'm here, aren't I?\" But if they've stopped putting in thoughtful energy, it can feel like they've emotionally checked out — even if they're technically present. And that dissonance can lead to withdrawal, disappointment, or even resentment.",
      relationalGrowthTips: "It's okay to own that small, thoughtful effort means a lot to you — but your partner may not instinctively know how to do it. Express what makes you feel remembered and cared for in real terms: \"When you surprise me with something small, it makes me feel so seen.\" Or, \"When I feel like you're paying attention to what I like, it means the world.\"\n\nYou can also help build this rhythm by modeling it. When you do thoughtful things, notice how it affects your partner. Point it out with warmth, not expectation. The goal isn't to create pressure — it's to cultivate mutual intentionality. Let your partner know that love, to you, is shown in the details. This is how you build trust, not just emotional intensity.\n\nAlso reflect on this: when do you pull back your thoughtful energy? Is it when you feel hurt, or when your gestures go unnoticed? If so, that's important to acknowledge. You may be tempted to stop giving altogether — but it might be more healing to say: \"I need to feel that the little things matter to you too.\" You are not high-maintenance. You are detail-attuned. The right relationship will make space for that — and learn to love you in the little things."
    },
    secondaryDescription: "You're someone who notices the little things — and when someone surprises you with a small, intentional gesture, it speaks directly to your heart. This might not be your dominant way of receiving love, but when someone remembers something specific to you or goes out of their way to make a small moment special, it makes you feel deeply seen. You don't need big gifts — just effort and attention. Thoughtfulness in action is still meaningful to you."

    title: "Intentional Time",
    emotionalCore: "You value presence over all else and feel most connected when someone gives you their undivided attention.",
    howYouFeelLoved: "Quality time with genuine presence, eye contact, and focused attention makes you feel truly valued and connected.",
    oftenMisread: "You might be seen as demanding or high-maintenance when you're really seeking depth of connection rather than quantity of time.",
    growthTips: "Be understanding that sometimes divided attention is necessary. Help your partner understand the difference between being physically present and truly present.",
    shortSummary: "You connect through quality time and undivided attention. When someone puts away distractions to fully focus on being with you, you feel deeply loved and secure.",
    color: "#D3E4FD", // Soft blue
    detailedDescription: {
      emotionalCore: "At the core of this Love Code is a deep belief: \"If I matter to you, you'll want to be with me — fully.\" You don't just need time together — you need intentional time. You're someone who values presence over proximity, attention over routine. You thrive in connection when your partner is fully with you, not just physically near, but mentally and emotionally available.\n\nTo you, time is not measured by clocks — it's measured by quality. A quiet 10-minute moment of real connection can mean more to you than hours of distracted multitasking. Your emotional world opens up when you sense someone is giving you the gift of their focus. When someone chooses to be with you without a phone in their hand, without checking notifications, without trying to \"fit you in,\" you feel safe, seen, and prioritized.\n\nYou likely notice when presence is fractured — when your partner seems checked out, even if they're in the same room. This doesn't make you needy. It makes you attuned. You sense when someone's energy isn't truly with you, and that lack of presence can feel like emotional abandonment. For you, connection lives in the now — not the \"later when things settle down.\"",
      howYouFeelLoved: "You feel most loved when someone chooses to spend intentional time with you. That could mean undistracted conversation, running errands together with music on, sharing a walk after a long day, or simply sitting next to each other with no agenda. It's not about what you do — it's about how much of them they bring into the moment with you.\n\nOne of your deepest joys is when someone clears space in their day just for you. When they say, \"Let's turn this into our time,\" or \"You have my full attention,\" your entire system relaxes. You feel emotionally safe when you're offered time without pressure — when someone just wants to be near you, not because they have to, but because they want to.\n\nIn relationships, this shows up in the way you value rituals and routines — maybe it's date nights, or morning coffee together, or even staying up to talk when everyone else is asleep. These windows of time build emotional intimacy for you. They signal: \"You are worth slowing down for.\" And when your partner does that consistently, it builds a strong foundation of connection that carries you through even the hardest seasons.",
      oftenMisread: "People who don't share this Love Code may assume you're asking for too much. They might say, \"We're always together,\" without realizing that presence isn't the same as availability. You don't want to monopolize time — you want to share it in a way that feels real, where both people are actually showing up. When that doesn't happen, you may feel distant or resentful, even if you're technically \"around each other.\"\n\nThis Love Code is also easily dismissed in fast-paced or overstimulated relationships. Partners may mistake your need for connection as \"clingy,\" or feel like they're failing because they can't carve out huge chunks of time. But what you're craving isn't hours — it's intentionality. And when your need for focused time is unmet, you may withdraw, feel unimportant, or even start questioning the health of the relationship altogether.\n\nIn conflict, this can become especially tricky. If a partner stonewalls, avoids reconnection, or brushes things off quickly, it can feel emotionally unsafe. You likely need space to talk things through, to understand and be understood. And when that time isn't given, or is given half-heartedly, it can feel like the emotional door is closed — and that disconnection runs deep for someone wired like you.",
      relationalGrowthTips: "Be honest about your need for time without apologizing for it. You're not asking for extravagance — you're asking for presence. Use language that is warm but clear, like: \"I feel closest when we have time that's just for us,\" or \"It means a lot to me when we slow down and connect, even if it's just for a few minutes.\"\n\nYou can also be proactive about suggesting rhythms of connection that make space for your Love Code. Instead of waiting for time to magically appear, help co-create it: \"Could we block 20 minutes a few nights this week just to check in?\" or \"Can this drive be our no-phones moment?\" You're not demanding attention — you're inviting intimacy.\n\nAlso reflect on how you handle unmet time needs. Do you get quiet, distant, or bitter when connection fades? If so, that's your sign to speak gently before the disconnect grows. You deserve a partner who chooses you on purpose — and in return, you offer the gift of deep, attuned attention that makes any relationship feel like home."
    },
    secondaryDescription: "Even if it's not your #1 Love Code, uninterrupted quality time still plays a big role in how you connect. You feel especially close to someone when they slow down and give you their full attention — whether that's during a deep conversation, a shared activity, or just doing nothing together. You may not need a ton of time, but the quality of it matters. Being present still carries a quiet power in your emotional world."
