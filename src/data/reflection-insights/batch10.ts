  {
    "triggers": [
      "you made me feel stupid",
      "humiliated",
      "mocked",
      "laughed at me",
      "shamed"
    ],
    "category": "shame_and_public_embarrassment",
    "insight": "This moment may have triggered deep shame or embarrassment for one of you.",
    "reflection": "Shame is one of the hardest emotions to process—and one of the most damaging when it shows up in relationships. If your partner feels mocked, dismissed, or made to feel 'less than,' even unintentionally, it creates lasting disconnection. Dignity must be protected, especially in conflict.",
    "recommendation": "Use this phrase as a repair tool: 'I realize what I said might've made you feel small—and that wasn't my intention. I'm sorry.' Simple, sincere dignity restores connection."
  },
  {
    "triggers": [
      "you didn't have my back",
      "you sided with them",
      "I felt betrayed",
      "you threw me under the bus"
    ],
    "category": "betrayal_or_loyalty_wound",
    "insight": "There may be a wound around loyalty, where one partner didn't feel emotionally protected.",
    "reflection": "In moments of tension with outsiders—friends, family, strangers—your partner is looking to see if you're beside them, not against them. Even neutrality can feel like betrayal when support is expected. Repair starts with choosing each other, publicly and privately.",
    "recommendation": "Have a conversation this week about what 'having each other's back' means to each of you. Define it together before the next moment calls for it."
  },
  {
    "triggers": [
      "you're so cold",
      "no emotion",
      "you're like a robot",
      "shut off",
      "no reaction"
    ],
    "category": "emotional_flatness_or_numbness",
    "insight": "There may be numbness showing up as emotional distance or flatness.",
    "reflection": "When someone is emotionally flat or unresponsive, it often means they've hit their capacity. It's not that they don't care—it's that they're overwhelmed, shut down, or emotionally exhausted. The challenge is to restore safety gently—not force a reaction.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of asking for emotion, ask: 'Is there something you're not saying right now that feels hard to name?' That opens the door without pressure."
  },
  {
    "triggers": [
      "you never change",
      "fake apology",
      "just say sorry to move on",
      "don't mean it",
      "empty words"
    ],
    "category": "empty_repair_or_performative_apologies",
    "insight": "There may be a pattern of surface-level apologies that don't lead to change.",
    "reflection": "A repair without behavior change is just emotional currency. When apologies are used to move on quickly or avoid accountability, trust deteriorates. What people want isn't perfection—it's evidence. Words backed by action.",
    "recommendation": "Start with this: 'Here's what I'm going to try to do differently next time…' Then ask your partner, 'What would repair look like for you?'"
  },
  {
    "triggers": [
      "you blame everything on me",
      "I'm always the bad guy",
      "you never own your part",
      "it's always my fault"
    ],
    "category": "unbalanced_blame",
    "insight": "This moment may reflect a pattern where one partner feels they carry all the blame.",
    "reflection": "When only one person in the relationship feels responsible for every mistake or misunderstanding, it creates deep resentment. Accountability should be mutual. Without shared ownership, even love begins to feel like judgment.",
    "recommendation": "Before resolving the next disagreement, ask each other: 'What's one part of this that might be mine to own?' Shared reflection creates shared growth."
