    "triggers": [
      "you compared me",
      "just like your ex",
      "why aren't you more like",
      "never enough"
    ],
    "category": "comparison_and_insecurity",
    "insight": "There may be feelings of comparison or not being enough fueling this tension.",
    "reflection": "Being compared—whether to an ex, a parent, or someone imaginary—can erode confidence in a relationship. It makes love feel conditional. When we feel like we're being measured, we stop feeling safe to show up as ourselves.",
    "recommendation": "If comparison has shown up lately, start a new ritual: share one thing you love about who your partner is—not who you wish they'd be."
  },
  {
    "triggers": [
      "you always shut me down",
      "nothing I say matters",
      "dismissive",
      "brush it off",
      "you minimize everything"
    ],
    "category": "dismissal_and_misattunement",
    "insight": "It sounds like one of you may be feeling emotionally dismissed.",
    "reflection": "Minimizing or brushing off a partner's concern doesn't make the issue go away—it makes it go inward. When we feel dismissed, we stop sharing. That silence can feel like safety at first, but it slowly erodes trust.",
    "recommendation": "Try reflecting one sentence back the next time your partner brings something up—even if you disagree. 'What I hear you saying is…' goes a long way in building safety."
  },
  {
    "triggers": [
      "too much pressure",
      "expectations",
      "I can't live up",
      "never good enough",
      "perfection"
    ],
    "category": "performance_pressure",
    "insight": "Someone may be feeling like they're being evaluated—not accepted.",
    "reflection": "Relationships thrive in a space where we're allowed to be whole and flawed. If one partner feels like they're constantly performing or being measured, emotional closeness starts to feel like a test. That's not love—it's stress.",
    "recommendation": "Pause this week to ask each other: 'Do you feel like I expect too much from you?' and actually listen. Sometimes love softens just by naming the pressure."
  },
  {
    "triggers": [
      "you don't support me",
      "I feel alone in this",
      "you don't back me up",
      "I'm on my own"
    ],
    "category": "lack_of_support",
    "insight": "This moment may have highlighted a deeper need for support and solidarity.",
    "reflection": "Support isn't just about logistics—it's about emotional presence. Feeling like your partner isn't in your corner—especially when life gets hard—can lead to a loneliness that words can't fix. The cure? Showing up. Repeatedly. Quietly. Faithfully.",
    "recommendation": "Ask: 'What's one thing I could do this week that would help you feel supported?' Then do it—without making it about earning points."
  },
  {
    "triggers": [
      "you used this against me",
      "threw it in my face",
      "weaponized",
      "you said you forgave me but",
      "you brought it back up"
    ],
    "category": "weaponized_vulnerability",
    "insight": "It sounds like someone's past vulnerability may have been used as a weapon in this conflict.",
    "reflection": "When we open up and share something hard—and later hear it thrown back at us—it teaches our nervous system not to trust again. Weaponized vulnerability is a silent killer of intimacy. Repair starts with accountability and renewed care for emotional safety.",
    "recommendation": "If something was shared in the past and reused during conflict, acknowledge it. A good phrase: 'I was wrong to use that against you. That wasn't fair.' Then ask: 'What would help you feel safer going forward?'"
