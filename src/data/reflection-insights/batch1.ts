  {
    "triggers": ["shut down", "walked away", "needed space", "left", "withdrew", "ignored", "talk to me", "alone"],
    "category": "space_vs_connection",
    "insight": "It sounds like one of you needed space, and the other needed connection.",
    "reflection": "When partners have mismatched needs in conflict, it can feel like abandonment on one side and overwhelm on the other. One person may be trying to protect their emotions, while the other is reaching out for comfort or clarity. Neither is wrong—what matters is learning how to name and time these needs together.",
    "recommendation": "Try choosing a shared pause word or phrase you can use in the future. It signals a need for space without fear of disconnection. Then revisit this conversation when you're both calmer—with care, not urgency."
  },
  {
    "triggers": ["do everything", "carry the load", "no help", "never helps", "always on me", "resentment"],
    "category": "resentment_and_imbalance",
    "insight": "There may be a feeling of imbalance or invisible effort in this relationship.",
    "reflection": "When resentment builds, it often means someone's effort or emotional labor is going unseen. You might be doing more than your partner realizes—not because they don't care, but because it hasn't been named clearly. And unspoken effort can quietly become anger.",
    "recommendation": "Work together this week to choose one small task or routine to rebalance. Then come back here and write a Love Note that acknowledges how you showed up for each other differently this time."
  },
  {
    "triggers": ["controlling", "forced", "can't choose", "decided for me", "manipulated", "never ask", "always decide"],
    "category": "control_vs_autonomy",
    "insight": "It sounds like one of you is craving more autonomy in decision-making.",
    "reflection": "Feeling controlled in a relationship can create emotional shutdown or rebellion. On the flip side, taking charge without checking in can stem from a desire to help or move quickly. The goal isn't to eliminate leadership—it's to build consent and collaboration into your choices.",
    "recommendation": "Choose one area of daily life this week—like meals, weekend plans, or family routines—and practice shared decision-making. Check in first. Let the other person weigh in, even if it seems small."
  },
  {
    "triggers": ["you always", "never listen", "blamed me", "wrong again", "you made me", "attacked", "accused"],
    "category": "blame_and_defensiveness",
    "insight": "There may be a pattern of blame that's leading to defensiveness instead of understanding.",
    "reflection": "Blame can feel like a shortcut to clarity, but it usually creates distance. It puts one person in the position of being wrong instead of heard. Defensive reactions then become armor—protecting, but not connecting.",
    "recommendation": "Try revisiting one point from this conflict using an 'I felt… when…' sentence. Instead of pointing out what your partner did wrong, try sharing how it landed for you emotionally."
  },
  {
    "triggers": ["unheard", "talked over", "dismissed", "cut me off", "didn't listen", "not heard", "ignored"],
    "category": "feeling_unheard",
    "insight": "It sounds like someone didn't feel fully heard in this moment.",
    "reflection": "Feeling unheard is one of the deepest emotional pain points in conflict. It's not always about volume or timing—it's about emotional recognition. Validation doesn't mean agreeing—it means pausing long enough to say, 'I get that this mattered to you.'",
    "recommendation": "Set a timer for just 3 minutes and take turns talking without interrupting. Let each person say what was hard, what they needed, and what they wish had gone differently. Then trade roles. Listening fully is a powerful act of repair."
