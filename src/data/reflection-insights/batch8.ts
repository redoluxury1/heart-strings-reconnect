    "triggers": [
      "why do I always have to explain",
      "you never get it",
      "I'm tired of spelling it out",
      "still don't understand"
    ],
    "category": "mental_exhaustion",
    "insight": "Someone may be emotionally exhausted from having to explain themselves over and over.",
    "reflection": "When someone feels like they have to make space for their partner's learning process—or have unknowingly leaned too hard on their emotional labor—emotional fatigue sets in. It can start to feel like the relationship depends on their effort alone. This isn't just about misunderstanding—it's about depletion.",
    "recommendation": "Pause and reflect: Have I made space for my partner's learning process—or have I unknowingly leaned too hard on their emotional labor? Ask each other what hasn't been said clearly yet."
  },
  {
    "triggers": [
      "I feel judged",
      "you're critical",
      "nothing I do is right",
      "always picking on me",
      "I can't win"
    ],
    "category": "criticism_and_shame",
    "insight": "There may be a dynamic of criticism that is triggering shame and disconnection.",
    "reflection": "Criticism erodes connection faster than almost anything. Even well-meaning feedback, when delivered without softness, can feel like an attack. Over time, the relationship starts to feel like a performance instead of a partnership.",
    "recommendation": "Try a compliment sandwich this week: when you need to offer feedback, start and end with what your partner is doing well. Not to soften truth—but to restore balance."
  },
  {
    "triggers": [
      "it's always about you",
      "you never ask how I am",
      "I'm invisible",
      "you don't notice"
    ],
    "category": "self-centeredness_or_emotional_neglect",
    "insight": "Someone may be feeling emotionally invisible or overlooked.",
    "reflection": "When only one person's needs, feelings, or experiences are centered, the relationship starts to tilt. Even subtle patterns of emotional neglect lead to deep loneliness. Sometimes, just being asked 'how are you really doing?' can begin the healing process.",
    "recommendation": "Build a new habit: once a day, ask your partner a check-in question—no agenda, no distractions. A small moment of attention can recalibrate everything."
  },
  {
    "triggers": [
      "I'm walking on eggshells",
      "afraid to speak up",
      "you'll explode",
      "can't be honest",
      "emotional landmine"
    ],
    "category": "fear_based_silence",
    "insight": "One of you may be afraid to speak honestly because of emotional volatility.",
    "reflection": "If someone feels like they have to manage your emotions in order to stay safe, you're not in a relationship—you're in a minefield. That fear silences truth, blocks growth, and builds resentment. Safety is the soil where honesty can grow.",
    "recommendation": "Create a 'safe start' ritual. Begin any hard conversation with the phrase: 'I want to bring something up, and I need us both to stay grounded.' That invitation sets the tone before the tension."
  },
  {
    "triggers": [
      "this again",
      "we never fix anything",
      "same issue",
      "nothing changes",
      "you don't learn"
    ],
    "category": "stuck_in_cycles",
    "insight": "This argument may be part of a larger pattern you haven't been able to break.",
    "reflection": "Repeating the same fight isn't always a sign of incompatibility—it's a sign that something deeper hasn't been named clearly enough. You're not stuck because you're broken. You're stuck because the cycle hasn't been interrupted with intention.",
    "recommendation": "Try the 'Let's Find the Pattern' tool. It helps you name what loop you keep getting caught in—so you can begin to build something new together."
