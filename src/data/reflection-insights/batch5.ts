  {
    "triggers": [
      "you embarrassed me",
      "not in front of them",
      "don't talk about me like that",
      "you made me look stupid"
    ],
    "category": "public_disrespect",
    "insight": "This conflict may have been fueled by feeling disrespected or criticized in front of others.",
    "reflection": "Being criticized publicly by a partner hits differently—it can feel like betrayal. Even small jokes or throwaway comments can trigger shame or humiliation, especially if they echo deeper insecurities. Dignity matters in conflict, especially when others are watching.",
    "recommendation": "Make a shared agreement to only address conflict in private. If something slips in public, use a short phrase like 'Let's pause this for later'—then return to it calmly once alone."
  },
  {
    "triggers": [
      "you don't show up",
      "I can't count on you",
      "you forgot",
      "you flaked again",
      "didn't follow through"
    ],
    "category": "reliability_and_follow_through",
    "insight": "One of you may be struggling to feel consistently supported or prioritized.",
    "reflection": "Trust isn't just about honesty—it's about follow-through. When promises or plans fall apart repeatedly, it sends a message that someone—or something else—comes first. The goal isn't perfection. It's consistency with care.",
    "recommendation": "Choose one recurring commitment—big or small—that you'll protect this week. Whether it's bedtime, dinner, or a check-in call—let your actions show what matters."
  },
  {
    "triggers": [
      "you never apologize",
      "you don't take ownership",
      "always my fault",
      "blame me for everything"
    ],
    "category": "accountability_and_repair",
    "insight": "Someone may be craving true accountability, not just closure.",
    "reflection": "Accountability isn't about blame—it's about naming impact. When hurt isn't acknowledged, it festers. Even a simple, sincere apology can shift the entire tone of a relationship. But it has to be real. Not rushed. Not transactional. Real.",
    "recommendation": "Try using this phrase: 'I can see how that landed for you, and I'm sorry it hurt.' You don't have to be the villain to acknowledge their pain."
  },
  {
    "triggers": [
      "you're always on your phone",
      "never present",
      "you don't even look at me",
      "checked out",
      "you're somewhere else"
    ],
    "category": "presence_and_attention",
    "insight": "This conflict may be about a lack of emotional presence—not just screen time.",
    "reflection": "When we feel ignored or emotionally abandoned, we often reach for irritation to cover up hurt. The real issue might not be about phones or distractions—it's about wanting to feel important, chosen, prioritized. That's a human need.",
    "recommendation": "Try setting aside 20 uninterrupted minutes each evening this week—phones away, eyes on each other. Not to solve problems, just to reconnect."
  },
  {
    "triggers": [
      "you never change",
      "always the same fight",
      "why bother",
      "it doesn't matter what I say"
    ],
    "category": "conflict_fatigue",
    "insight": "This may be a sign of conflict fatigue—where the same unresolved pattern keeps looping.",
    "reflection": "When a fight happens again and again, it becomes less about the content and more about the hopelessness. Conflict fatigue is when you feel like nothing you say will make a difference. But real change starts with interrupting the cycle—not perfectly, just intentionally.",
    "recommendation": "Before your next disagreement, agree on one phrase you can both use to pause the spiral. Maybe it's 'Let's try that again.' Sometimes stopping the loop is the first breakthrough."
