  {
    "triggers": [
      "I can't trust you",
      "you're hiding something",
      "suspicious",
      "you're being secretive",
      "not telling the whole truth"
    ],
    "category": "trust_and_transparency",
    "insight": "This conflict may reflect a deeper concern around trust or transparency.",
    "reflection": "When trust feels shaky, even small actions—like tone, timing, or privacy—can feel loaded. Lack of transparency doesn't always mean deception, but it does create emotional distance. Rebuilding trust is slow, consistent, and grounded in clarity.",
    "recommendation": "This week, pick one area where you can offer proactive transparency—whether it's plans, feelings, or context. Trust grows in the small moments."
  },
  {
    "triggers": [
      "you never initiate",
      "I always reach out",
      "you don't try",
      "it's one-sided",
      "you don't make an effort"
    ],
    "category": "effort_imbalance",
    "insight": "Someone may be feeling like they're carrying the emotional or relational weight alone.",
    "reflection": "When one partner constantly initiates—whether it's conversation, affection, or repair—it creates a quiet fatigue. Relationships need mutual pursuit, not just mutual tolerance. Even small acts of effort can restore balance.",
    "recommendation": "Ask: 'What's one way I could show you I'm in this with you?'—and don't wait for conflict to answer it."
  },
  {
    "triggers": [
      "you flipped it on me",
      "gaslighting",
      "made me feel crazy",
      "twisted my words",
      "denied it happened"
    ],
    "category": "manipulation_or_gaslighting",
    "insight": "This moment may have involved emotional manipulation or misrepresentation of truth.",
    "reflection": "When someone's reality is denied or twisted, it creates emotional erosion. They start to question themselves more than the relationship. Even if gaslighting isn't intentional, the impact is lasting. Repair means choosing truth—even when it's uncomfortable.",
    "recommendation": "Take time to validate one specific detail your partner shared—even if it's hard to hear. It's not about who's right. It's about creating safety."
  },
  {
    "triggers": [
      "we're just roommates",
      "no spark",
      "nothing exciting anymore",
      "bored",
      "we don't laugh"
    ],
    "category": "emotional_disconnection",
    "insight": "This conflict may be highlighting a deeper disconnection or emotional drift.",
    "reflection": "Many couples hit seasons where connection fades into function. It doesn't mean love is gone—it means intention is missing. The spark doesn't disappear—it just needs oxygen. That usually starts with laughter, presence, and curiosity again.",
    "recommendation": "Plan one low-effort, high-connection moment this week. No pressure, just play. Then come back and send each other a Love Note about it."
  },
  {
    "triggers": [
      "you shut me out",
      "stonewalling",
      "refused to talk",
      "ignored me",
      "cold"
    ],
    "category": "stonewalling_and_emotional_distance",
    "insight": "Someone may have emotionally withdrawn in a way that triggered deeper fear or anger.",
    "reflection": "Stonewalling isn't about silence—it's about emotional detachment. It can feel like abandonment to the person on the other side. Learning to signal the need for space while still staying emotionally present is key.",
    "recommendation": "Try agreeing on a simple phrase that signals pause but not punishment—like 'I need 15 minutes to reset.' It can be the difference between distance and repair."
