  {
    "triggers": ["unsafe", "scared", "intense", "yelling", "raised voice", "too much", "anxious", "emotionally unsafe"],
    "category": "emotional_safety",
    "insight": "It sounds like emotional safety may have been missing in this moment.",
    "reflection": "Feeling emotionally or physically unsafe can shut someone down instantly, even if the topic matters deeply. It's hard to stay open when your nervous system feels under threat. Creating safety in conflict isn't about being perfect—it's about showing your partner that your love can stay calm, even when your voice shakes.",
    "recommendation": "Set some shared boundaries now—like no raised voices, and taking breaks when things feel heated. Try the Time Out tool under 'Mid-Fight' to create a calm-down plan together."
  },
  {
    "triggers": ["left me", "abandoned", "walked away", "disconnected", "left alone", "you always leave", "never stay"],
    "category": "abandonment_fear",
    "insight": "One of you may be carrying fears of abandonment or emotional disconnection.",
    "reflection": "When leaving a conversation—even briefly—triggers deep fear, it's rarely about just that moment. It often ties back to emotional wounds: being left, being silenced, not being considered. That fear can come out as clinginess, anger, or panic. Naming the need for security is the first step.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of just walking away when things escalate, try saying: 'I need space, but I'll come back in 20 minutes.' It helps your partner feel grounded—even during distance."
  },
  {
    "triggers": ["dramatic", "overreacting", "you're too sensitive", "not a big deal", "I was just joking"],
    "category": "emotional_invalidation",
    "insight": "Someone may have felt emotionally invalidated during this conflict.",
    "reflection": "When someone is told their feelings are an overreaction, it teaches them to suppress their emotional truth. That doesn't lead to peace—it leads to resentment and internal confusion. Validating someone doesn't mean agreeing—it means saying, 'I can see that this affected you.'",
    "recommendation": "Try revisiting one statement with a new phrase: 'I didn't realize that hit you that way—thank you for telling me.' Validation is one of the most powerful tools in connection."
  },
  {
    "triggers": ["cheated", "lied", "betrayed", "trust", "I don't believe you", "you said one thing", "broke my trust"],
    "category": "trust_repair",
    "insight": "This conflict may be connected to a deeper rupture in trust.",
    "reflection": "When trust has been broken—whether recently or in the past—it colors every disagreement. Even small tensions feel like proof of a bigger pattern. Healing doesn't happen by ignoring it. It happens by creating new evidence, moment by moment, that safety is being rebuilt.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of jumping into 'fix it' mode, try saying: 'I want to earn your trust back, and I'm open to hearing what that looks like for you.' Then truly listen."
  },
  {
    "triggers": ["we want different things", "we're not on the same page", "don't understand each other", "misaligned", "confused", "pulled in different directions"],
    "category": "conflicting_needs",
    "insight": "You may both be trying to meet different emotional needs in the same moment.",
    "reflection": "Sometimes, two people can love each other deeply—and still want opposite things at the same time. That's not failure. It's human. The key is staying curious, not competitive: What does your partner need right now? What do you need? Is there any overlap?",
    "recommendation": "Try using the 'Let's Talk This Out' prompt library to name what you each need without interruption. Don't look for the perfect compromise yet—just get clear on what's true for both of you."
