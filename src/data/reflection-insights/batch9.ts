  {
    "triggers": [
      "don't touch me",
      "too tired",
      "I'm not in the mood",
      "leave me alone",
      "stop asking"
    ],
    "category": "tension_around_physical_affection",
    "insight": "There may be emotional tension manifesting as physical withdrawal.",
    "reflection": "When emotional disconnect shows up as physical avoidance, it can feel like rejection—even if it's not. Sometimes the issue isn't intimacy—it's exhaustion, resentment, or lack of trust. Without emotional closeness, physical closeness often suffers too.",
    "recommendation": "Instead of initiating physical affection, ask: 'What would help you feel more connected to me today?' Emotional safety often unlocks physical comfort."
  },
  {
    "triggers": [
      "you don't respect me",
      "talk down to me",
      "treat me like a child",
      "condescending"
    ],
    "category": "respect_and_power_dynamics",
    "insight": "This conflict may be rooted in a perceived power imbalance or lack of mutual respect.",
    "reflection": "Respect is foundational in any relationship. When one partner feels belittled—especially in conflict—it shifts the dynamic from partnership to hierarchy. Repair starts with language, tone, and the willingness to see your partner as an equal, even when you disagree.",
    "recommendation": "Next time you disagree, try saying: 'I see where you're coming from, even if I see it differently.' Respect doesn't require agreement—just dignity."
  },
  {
    "triggers": [
      "you never let me finish",
      "interrupted",
      "you just talk over me",
      "I couldn't say anything"
    ],
    "category": "communication_dominance",
    "insight": "One of you may be dominating the conversation, even without realizing it.",
    "reflection": "When someone repeatedly interrupts, over-explains, or monopolizes dialogue, the quieter partner can feel erased. It's not just about airtime—it's about emotional presence. Conversation isn't a competition. It's a dance.",
    "recommendation": "Try a simple turn-taking practice: set a 2-minute timer where each person speaks without interruption. When the timer ends, switch roles. Use this for harder conversations moving forward."
  },
  {
    "triggers": [
      "you joke too much",
      "you never take it seriously",
      "everything's a joke",
      "you made fun of me"
    ],
    "category": "deflection_through_humor",
    "insight": "Humor may be masking discomfort—or invalidating emotional truth.",
    "reflection": "Humor can be a beautiful connector, but it can also be a shield. When jokes show up in the middle of emotional moments, they often deflect vulnerability. If your partner shares something serious and is met with a punchline, they may stop opening up.",
    "recommendation": "If you're tempted to joke, pause and ask: 'Is this a moment for laughter, or for listening?' Let humor connect you—don't let it cover up what's real."
  },
  {
    "triggers": [
      "I feel like I'm parenting you",
      "I already have kids",
      "why do I have to remind you",
      "do everything for you"
    ],
    "category": "parentified_partner_dynamic",
    "insight": "This moment may reflect a dynamic where one partner feels overly responsible for the other.",
    "reflection": "When a partner starts to feel like they're 'parenting' the other, it creates resentment, imbalance, and burnout. Often this stems from unspoken expectations, role confusion, or a lack of follow-through. You're equals—not parent and child.",
    "recommendation": "Each partner should write down one responsibility they've been avoiding and one thing they're proud of managing. Share them aloud. Rebalance begins with clarity."
