  {
    "triggers": [
      "you don't care",
      "I'm not a priority",
      "last on your list",
      "forgot about me",
      "not important to you"
    ],
    "category": "feeling_deprioritized",
    "insight": "One of you may be feeling like you're no longer a priority.",
    "reflection": "Feeling deprioritized in a relationship often doesn't come from grand betrayals—it comes from small moments of absence. When gestures of connection fade, it can leave someone feeling unseen, even if love is still present. This isn't about blame—it's about recalibrating attention.",
    "recommendation": "Each of you choose one simple ritual this week—a daily check-in, a shared meal, a hug in the morning. Small consistency builds trust faster than big gestures."
  },
  {
    "triggers": [
      "always defensive",
      "can't talk to you",
      "you twist everything",
      "I'm walking on eggshells"
    ],
    "category": "communication_breakdown",
    "insight": "There may be a pattern of defensiveness that makes open communication feel unsafe.",
    "reflection": "When one or both partners are constantly bracing for criticism, real dialogue shuts down. Conversations become performances or battles. The goal is to make room for truth without triggering protection mode.",
    "recommendation": "Try using 'I' language next time conflict arises: 'I felt... when...' instead of 'You never...'. This small shift reduces defensiveness and increases connection."
  },
  {
    "triggers": [
      "you don't get it",
      "I'm alone in this",
      "why do I always have to explain",
      "nobody understands me"
    ],
    "category": "emotional_isolation",
    "insight": "Someone may be carrying the weight of emotional isolation.",
    "reflection": "Emotional isolation in a relationship often feels worse than being physically alone. It's not just about needing attention—it's about needing resonance. That sense of 'you see me in this.' Without it, we start to question whether our experiences are valid.",
    "recommendation": "Take five minutes tonight to ask your partner: 'What felt hard for you this week that I might've missed?' Then reflect it back in your own words—just to show you heard."
  },
  {
    "triggers": [
      "bring this up again",
      "you never let it go",
      "still mad about that",
      "can't move on",
      "old fight"
    ],
    "category": "unresolved_wounds",
    "insight": "This conflict may be touching an older wound that never fully healed.",
    "reflection": "When an old wound is reactivated, it often gets mislabeled as overreacting. But repeated conflict is often repeated pain. Until something is resolved, your body and brain treat it like it just happened. That's not immaturity—it's memory.",
    "recommendation": "If this issue has come up more than once, try journaling individually about what part still hurts. Then swap journals and read silently—no defense, just understanding."
  },
  {
    "triggers": [
      "don't touch me",
      "not in the mood",
      "stop trying",
      "cold",
      "you always want something"
    ],
    "category": "disconnected_intimacy",
    "insight": "There may be a growing disconnect around emotional or physical closeness.",
    "reflection": "When physical affection becomes a source of tension, it often means emotional safety is out of sync. One partner may seek touch as connection; the other may avoid it to protect themselves. It's rarely about rejection—it's about emotional mismatch.",
    "recommendation": "Spend 10 minutes together in silence—just sitting near each other. No fixing, no expectation. Sometimes rebuilding safety begins in stillness, not words."
