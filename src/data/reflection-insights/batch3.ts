    "triggers": [
      "don't want sex",
      "never in the mood",
      "different needs",
      "avoid intimacy",
      "shut down physically"
    ],
    "category": "intimacy_mismatch",
    "insight": "It sounds like you may have mismatched needs around intimacy or physical connection.",
    "reflection": "Intimacy isn't just about sex—it's about safety, attunement, and how we express closeness. When one partner feels rejected and the other feels pressured, both can become defensive. Often, this disconnect isn't about desire—it's about deeper emotional needs not being met.",
    "recommendation": "Have a conversation outside the bedroom about what intimacy means to each of you. You might be speaking different languages without realizing it. Try the 'Love Codes' quiz if you haven't already."
  },
  {
    "triggers": [
      "I do everything",
      "mental load",
      "always on me",
      "burned out",
      "overwhelmed",
      "no help with the kids"
    ],
    "category": "emotional_labor",
    "insight": "There may be a pattern of emotional or invisible labor falling unevenly on one of you.",
    "reflection": "When one partner becomes the emotional or logistical manager of the household or relationship, it leads to burnout. The issue isn't just doing tasks—it's feeling alone in the responsibility. Recognition and rebalancing are the first steps toward repair.",
    "recommendation": "Start the week by asking each other: 'What can I take off your plate this week?' Then follow through—and check in again on Sunday."
  },
  {
    "triggers": [
      "parenting",
      "kids",
      "discipline",
      "you undermine me",
      "in front of the kids",
      "not aligned as parents"
    ],
    "category": "parenting_tension",
    "insight": "This conflict may be about more than parenting—it's about teamwork and trust.",
    "reflection": "Parenting often becomes a mirror for how aligned or misaligned we feel. When one partner feels undermined or unsupported, it creates a divide that's deeper than logistics. The goal isn't always perfect agreement—it's showing your kids what respectful disagreement looks like.",
    "recommendation": "Set aside 20 minutes this week to talk about how each of you was raised. What do you want to repeat? What do you want to rewrite? That conversation is more powerful than any discipline plan."
  },
  {
    "triggers": [
      "shut down",
      "I froze",
      "nothing to say",
      "blank",
      "numb",
      "closed off"
    ],
    "category": "emotional_shutdown",
    "insight": "One of you may be experiencing emotional shutdown in the face of conflict.",
    "reflection": "Shutting down is often misunderstood as avoidance—but it's usually self-protection. When someone shuts down, their body is saying 'I can't handle more stimulation right now.' That's not weakness. It's wiring. Learn to notice the signs earlier, and slow the moment down.",
    "recommendation": "Create a 'slow signal' between you—like a gesture, phrase, or pause word—so that when one of you starts to freeze, you can both take a breath before continuing."
  },
  {
    "triggers": [
      "I'm scared to say",
      "don't want to get hurt",
      "too vulnerable",
      "afraid you'll leave",
      "if I open up"
    ],
    "category": "fear_of_vulnerability",
    "insight": "There may be fear around emotional vulnerability at the root of this conflict.",
    "reflection": "Sometimes conflict isn't about what was said—it's about what wasn't. When we fear being vulnerable, we say half-truths or lash out to protect ourselves. But real connection requires risk. You can't build intimacy and armor at the same time.",
    "recommendation": "Try finishing the sentence: 'If I were being totally honest, I would say…'—even if you write it down first. You don't have to share it right away. You just have to practice saying it."
